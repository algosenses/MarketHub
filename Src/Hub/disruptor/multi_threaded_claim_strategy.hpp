    /// \brief
    /// A claim strategy for slots in a ring buffer where there are multiple
    /// producer threads all concurrently trying to write items to the ring
    /// buffer.
    ///
    /// When a writer wants to write to a slot in the queue it first atomically
    /// increments a counter by the number of slots it wishes to allocate.
    /// It then waits until all of those slots have become available and then
    /// returns the range of sequence numbers allocated back to the caller.
    /// The caller then writes to those slots and when done publishes them
    /// by writing the sequence numbers published to each of the slots to
    /// the corresponding element of an array of equal size to the ring buffer.
    /// When a reader wants to check if the next sequence number is available
    /// it them simply needs to read from the corresponding slot in this array
    /// to check if the value stored there is equal to the sequence number it
    /// is wanting to read.
    ///
    /// This means concurrent writers are wait-free when there is space available
    /// in the ring buffer, requiring a single atomic fetch-add operation as the
    /// only contended write operation. All other writes are to memory locations
    /// owned by a particular writer. Concurrent writers can publish items
    /// out-of-order so that one writer does not hold up other writers until the
    /// ring buffer fills up.
