    /// Call \ref spin_once() each time through the loop
    /// to wait for a short time. Initially just trying to
    /// put the CPU into an idle mode (eg. to allow other
    /// hyper-threads on same core to run) and eventually
    /// yielding the rest of the thread's time-slice or
    /// putting the thread to sleep for a short time.
    ///
    /// For example:
    /// \code
    /// std::atomic<bool>& flag = someSharedFlag;
    /// disruptorplus::spin_wait spinner;
    /// while (!flag.load())
    /// {
    ///    spinner.spin_once();
    /// }
    /// \endcode

    /// \note
    /// On single-core machines this will not with the CPU
    /// idling phase and will proceed straight to yielding
    /// the remainder of the thread time-slice.
