/// Defines typedefs and utility functions relating to sequence numbers.
///
/// Sequence numbers are a central concept in Disruptor++ as sequence numbers
/// are used to indicate the order that items were added to a ring buffer
/// and hence their location in the ring buffer.
///
/// Sequence numbers can overflow back to zero so all comparisons of sequence
/// numbers need to take this into account by calling the
/// \ref disruptorplus::difference(sequence_t,sequence_t) function.

/// \brief
/// The \ref disruptorplus namespace provides abstractions that implement the
/// Disruptor data structure for multi-threaded producer/consumer queues.
